	    <strong>Purpose:</strong>
	    The purpose of the PCA National Championship Points System is to determine a PCA National Champion and a subsequent finishing order in each class for each calendar year. The GTD class will not be part of this championship as they will run in a separate championship.
	  </li>
 	  <li>
	    <strong>Eligible Drivers:</strong>
	    Drivers must be PCA Club Racing License holders in good standing.
	  </li>
 	  <li>
	    <strong>General Points:</strong>
	    All races where points are available will have the same basic structure for earning points. Cars which do not finish will not be awarded points and will not be shown in a finishing position in race results. They will be shown at the bottom of the score sheet as DNF. To finish the race, a car must be running on track when the winner crosses the finish line and subsequently cross the finish line timing loop on track or in the hot pit. However, if with normal traffic flow, it is not possible to cross the finish line timing loop in the hot pits then the finish must be on track to avoid a DNF. Only races with standard starting and scoring will be points scoring races. For example, handicap races or inverted grids will not be points scoring races. Any points scoring races must be open to all racers. That is, any race that has special qualifications will not award points. (example ‐ night race with extra experience requirement)
	    </li>
 	  <li><strong>Position Points:</strong>
	    Position points will only be awarded to cars that finish the race. Position points will only be awarded for finishing positions in class. The overall finishing position within the group does not earn points. Racers who finish 1st in class will earn 10 points, 2nd 7 points, 3rd 5 points, 4th 4 points, 5th 3 points, 6th 2 points and 7th 1 point. Points will be awarded in class for enduros in the same way as in sprint races. If two or more drivers share a car during an enduro, the total points earned by that car will be split equally among the drivers who drove it in that race.<br><br>
              Points for in-class finishing position will be awared as follows:
		<table class="data" title="Scores for In-class Finishing Position">
                  <tr>
                    <th>1st</th>
                    <th>2nd</th>
                    <th>3rd</th>
                    <th>4th</th>
                    <th>5th</th>
                    <th>6th</th>
                    <th>7th</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>10</td>
                    <td>7</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                  </tr>
		</table>
	  </li>
 	  <li>
	    <strong>Bonus Points:</strong>
	    A racer will earn 1 bonus point for each car in class that finishes the race behind the car driven by that racer. Bonus points will be earned by all cars finishing the race except the car that finishes last in the class. Cars that do not finish the race (DNF) or are disqualified (DQ) do not count as cars beaten in the class. There will be a 10 point limit on bonus points available in any race. For example: The car that finishes 21st in a 22 car field where all 22 cars finish will earn 1 bonus point. In that same race the car that finishes first will earn 10 bonus points.
	  </li>
 	  <li>
	    <strong>Event Points:</strong>
	    Each racer will earn 5 points for each event attended where the racer starts and finishes at least one scheduled race. The fun race does not count. For position, bonus, and event points, to qualify as starting the racer must have passed the starter stand on the track after the green flag has been displayed to start the race. A late start after the field has started will count as a start if the racer passes the starter stand on the track. And to qualify as finishing the racer must be running on track when the winner crosses the finish line and subsequently cross the finish line timing loop on track or in the hot pit if it is possible at that track. There will be a maximum of 25 points available for each year in this category.
	  </li>
 	  <li><strong>Championship Totals:</strong>
	    The best 13 race point totals for each racer in all points scoring races for the year will count toward the National Championship. Ties for the first three positions will be broken by the highest total in the 9th race then 10 th race etc. A racer must successfully complete a minimum of 7 race starts in point scoring races to be eligible for a National Podium Award. Starts for this requirement will be as described in VI above.
	  </li>
 	  <li>
	    <strong>Points Races:</strong>
	    Not all races in a race weekend will have points available. The final two scheduled sprint races will have points awarded. If an enduro is offered, it will have points awarded. If an enduro is not offered, the third‐to‐last scheduled sprint race will have points awarded. There will be three points races per class. For Example: Suppose a race event has three groups of races (red, green, yellow), and each of those groups have three sprint races and then the racers are regrouped and there are two enduro races (purple and pink run groups). In this scenario, the final two sprint races for red, green, and yellow are the points scoring sprint races and both of the enduros are points scoring races. For purposes of determining which races are points races, the final schedule approved by the Steward prior to the beginning of the event will be used.
	  </li>
 	  <li>
	    <strong>Schedule Changes:</strong>
	    If the event National Steward determines that the event schedule must be changed after it is posted as final for any reason (example – for weather or track issues), the Steward will announce which three races (if available) will be the points scoring races when the revised schedule is announced. The goal in that case will be for racers to stay for as much of the event as safely possible. The Stewards decision will be final.
	  </li>
 	  <li>
	    <strong>Review:</strong>
	    Any driver who believes that points awarded in any race are inaccurate may request a review of the points awarded by written (or email) request to the PCA Club Racing Chairman within thirty (30) days of the last day of the race in question. Said request shall provide all documentation and/or justification as to why the points awarded should be reviewed.
	  </li>
 	  <li>
	    <strong>13-13 Sanction:</strong>
	    A 13‐13 sanction (probation or suspension) during the calendar year will cause the sanctioned driver to be ineligible for a National Championship. The driver will be dropped from the National Championship points totals.
	  </li>
 	  <li>
	    <strong>Race Cars:</strong>
	    All Race Cars scoring points must be properly classed and have a current log book. Disqualification of the car due to performance related compliance issues will cause at a minimum a loss of all points that have been earned by that car while in a non‐compliant condition. For example disqualification of the car due to illegal engine modifications discovered after the last race will cause a loss of all points earned by that car from the weekend and possibly a 13‐13 sanction. Disqualification based on the car being underweight by less than thirty pounds will cause a loss of points for the session immediately prior to the weighing. Disqualification caused by the car being thirty pounds or more underweight will cause a loss of all points earned that weekend prior to the disqualification.
	  </li>
 	  <li>
	    <strong>Zone Championships:</strong>
	    In addition to the National Championship Points System, a PCA Zone may have a Zone Championship. It is also possible for several Zones to join together in a Series Championship. All Zone and Series Championships and their Program details regarding driver and class eligibility must be pre‐approved by the PCA Club Racing Committee. Zone or Series Championships will be determined in accordance with the above National Championship Rules used to determine a PCA National Champion and a subsequent finishing order in each class for each calendar year. Any exceptions must be approved by the Club Racing National committee. The GTD class will not be part of Zone or Series Championships as they will run in a separate championship. If Zones elect to have a Championship, points will be totaled by Zone or Series for each racer whose home region is in the participating Zone(s). Zone Championships will include points scored in races outside of the Zone. Zone totals will include all races the drivers have run in or out of the zone. For example, a racer whose home region is in Zone 2 will earn points for the Zone Championship in Zone 2 from a race in which he/she has competed in Zone 5 during that championship year if it is among his/her best 8 point totals for that year. Series Championships totals will include points scored in all races the drivers have run in the Series as determined by Series Championship Rules.
